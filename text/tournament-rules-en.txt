Ravensburger and the Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game Organized Play Team work to provide a
welcoming, open, supportive, and safe environment for all event participants. Part of this work includes
setting rules and standards for tournament roles, processes, and game play procedures.

All tournament participants agree to abide by the rules outlined in this document. Corrective action may
be taken if these rules are not followed. Other applicable documents that participants must all adhere to
include:
• Disney Lorcana TCG Community Code
• Disney Lorcana TCG Correction Guidelines
• Disney Lorcana TCG Organized Play Diversity & Inclusion Policy

Section 1: Tournament Definitions

1.1 Tournament Types

Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two types:

Limited tournaments are played with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product that is provided by the
Tournament Organizer. Players are not expected to bring any Disney Lorcana TCG cards with them to
participate in a Limited tournament. Limited includes the Preconstructed, Sealed, and Draft variants.

Constructed tournaments are played with decks that the players have built before the tournament
begins. Each player is responsible for bringing a deck that is legal for the specific Constructed format
being played at that tournament.

1.2 Tournament Levels

Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two levels.

Casual tournaments are played with more relaxed rules and fewer, if any, prizes. These tournaments are
intended for less serious play; tournament officials are responsible for assuring that these events are
welcoming to less-experienced players.

Competitive tournaments are intended for more serious play, with stricter rules and higher expectations
of players.

1.3 Tournament Roles

Tournaments may have multiple roles represented:

    •   Tournament Organizer
    •   Head Judge
    •   Floor Judge
    •   Scorekeeper
    •   Player
    •   Spectator


                                                     2
All of the above roles except Player and Spectator are considered Tournament Officials. For purposes of
this document, “judge” refers to anyone acting as Head Judge or floor judge in that tournament.

1.4 Eligible Players and Tournament Officials

Anyone is eligible to play in any Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the following exceptions:

    •   Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events.
    •   Any Tournament Official for that tournament.

Anyone is eligible to serve as a Tournament Official for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the
following exceptions:

    •   Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events.
    •   Anyone who has played in that tournament, even if they have dropped.



Section 2: Tournament Roles

2.1 Tournament Organizer

The Tournament Organizer for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament is responsible for a number of tasks,
including but not limited to:

    •   Obtaining permission from Ravensburger to run the tournament.
    •   Providing and furnishing a sufficient site to run the tournament.
    •   Promoting the tournament to ensure sufficient attendance.
    •   Advertising the tournament type and format for player preparation.
    •   Acquiring sufficient staff for the tournament (e.g., judges and a scorekeeper).
    •   Reporting the tournament results to Ravensburger.

2.2 Head Judge

Every Disney Lorcana TCG tournament must have a Tournament Official designated as the Head Judge for
that event. This person must be physically present throughout the duration of the event. For Casual
tournaments, the Tournament Organizer may serve as the Head Judge. For Competitive tournaments,
they must be two separate individuals.

The Head Judge is the final arbiter for any rules or tournament policy disputes at a Disney Lorcana TCG
tournament. It is their responsibility to enforce the codes in this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Full
Rules, and the Disney Lorcana TCG Penalty Guidelines. All tournament participants are expected to abide
by the Head Judge’s decisions.

For smaller tournaments, the Head Judge should be the only judge needed. For larger tournaments, the
Head Judge is expected to delegate tasks to other judges as necessary to facilitate smooth tournament
function and timely responses to player questions.

If a player is dissatisfied with a judge’s ruling, they may appeal the ruling to the Head Judge. The Head
Judge’s ruling is final.



                                                     3
If any players must be disqualified or otherwise removed from a tournament, the Head Judge must write
a report of the incident and submit it to Ravensburger.

2.3 Judges

Judges are charged with assisting players with rules questions and handling errors made during play.
They are expected to be impartial and to avoid assisting players with in-game strategy. Judges should not
prevent play mistakes from happening but should instead only pause a match if an illegal action is taken
or if a situation requires de-escalation. Judges should hold themselves to a high standard of sporting
behavior and should exemplify this to players and spectators whenever serving as a judge for a
tournament.

2.4 Scorekeeper

The Scorekeeper is responsible for recording all tournament results and generating all tournament
pairings. For smaller tournaments, this role may be served by the Tournament Organizer or a judge. This
person should be familiar with the Melee software (www.melee.gg) so that any issues or errors can be
corrected in a timely manner and with minimal disruption to the tournament. If any egregious
tournament scorekeeping issues arise, the Head Judge is the final arbiter for determining the
appropriate action.

2.5 Player

Players in Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments have several responsibilities:

    •   Always being respectful and courteous toward Tournament Officials, other players, and
        spectators.
    •   Refraining from unsporting conduct at all times.
    •   Arriving for the tournament and for all matches punctually.
    •   Supplying all required tournament materials, including an appropriate deck for Constructed
        tournaments. This can also include dice, a playmat, pen and paper, and non-marked card
        sleeves.
    •   For Competitive Constructed tournaments, submitting their deck list via Melee or on paper.
    •   Verifying that their match results are reported promptly and accurately.
    •   Properly communicating with their opponent to the best of their ability.
    •   Bringing any and all issues to the attention of a judge as soon as they are noticed.
    •   Abiding by the rules of this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Full Rules, the Disney Lorcana
        TCG Correction Guidelines, and all rulings made by judges.

Any assistance given by a judge does not remove these responsibilities.

2.6 Spectator

Spectators are expected to allow Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments to proceed unaffected by their
observation. Any person physically present at a Disney Lorcana TCG event who is not filling a designated
tournament role is considered a spectator.

Spectators are expected to remain silent and unobtrusive while matches proceed, with one exception. If
a spectator observes a rule violation, they should ask the players to pause their game while the spectator


                                                    4
notifies a judge. The spectator should not reveal any details of the perceived violation to the players but
should instead relay the information to the judge so that the situation can be addressed correctly.

Players may always request that a spectator not observe their match. This request should involve a
judge. Tournament Officials may always restrict the ability of spectators to observe matches.



Section 3: Tournament Operations

3.1 Player Minimums

A tournament must have a minimum of eight players to be considered an official Disney Lorcana TCG
tournament. If at least eight people are not present and ready to participate, the tournament is no
longer officially sanctioned by Ravensburger and should be reported as Canceled.

3.2 Round Minimums

At least three rounds must be played for a tournament to be considered an official Disney Lorcana TCG
tournament. If at least three rounds are not played, the tournament is no longer officially sanctioned by
Ravensburger and should be reported as Canceled. For a better player experience, tournaments with
more players have more rounds. The recommended number of rounds to be played based on the
number of players in the first round are as follows:

Players     Swiss Rounds                                           Playoff Format
8          3 Single-Elimination Rounds                             None
           4 for Limited tournament with Booster Draft Playoff Top 8 Booster Draft (if Limited)
9-16
           5 for Core Constructed                              Top 4 (if Core Constructed)
17-32      5                                                       Top 8
33-64      6                                                       Top 8
65-128     7                                                       Top 8
129-226    8                                                       Top 8


3.3 Match Structure

The Disney Lorcana TCG is played in a best-of-three format. In practice, this means that the players will
play games until one player has won two games. Drawn games do not count as wins. If the match is
concluded before one player has won two games, then the player who has won the most games is the
winner of the match. If both players have the same number of wins at this point, the match is a draw.

Before the match begins, the players must randomly decide which player has the choice of playing first
or second. Any mutually agreed-upon method may be used, such as rolling dice or flipping a coin. The
deciding player then chooses whether they will play first or second. The player who plays first does not
draw a card at the start of their first turn.




                                                     5
For any games after the first in a match, the player who lost the most recent game chooses whether to
play first or second in the next game. If the most recent game was a draw, then the same player who
chose for that game chooses for the next game as well.

The decision to play first or second must be made before the player sees their opening hand for that
game. If the player fails to do so, they are assumed to be playing first.

3.4 Match Procedure

When beginning a game, players first decide which player is playing first as described in section 3.1. Each
player shuffles their deck and offers their opponent the opportunity for additional shuffling and/or
cutting. Then, each player draws their opening hand of seven cards.

For every game of a match, each player has the opportunity to alter their hand. First, the first player
chooses which cards from their hand they will alter and places those cards on the bottom of their deck in
any order. Then the second player chooses which cards from their hand they will alter and places those
cards on the bottom of their own deck in any order. Then both players draw cards until both have seven
cards in their hand again. Finally, any player who placed cards on the bottom of their deck in this manner
shuffles their deck and then offers their opponent the opportunity for additional shuffling and/or cutting.

Once this process has been completed, the first player begins their first turn. They will not draw a card
for this turn.

Once time has been called in a round, no new games should begin. Any games still in progress will
immediately proceed to the end-of-match procedure, as follows:

    •   The active player finishes their turn.
    •   After that turn, there are five turns total remaining in the game.
    •   Each turn taken after the turn during which time was called will count toward the five-game
        total, regardless of whose turn it is. Normally, this means that the active player when time was
        called will get two turns and the non-active player will get three turns.
    •   If the game ends during these turns, the match is reported normally.
    •   If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and one player has more game wins
        than the other, that player wins the match. (The current game does not count toward the match
        result.)
    •   Swiss rounds: If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and both players have
        the same number of game wins, the match is a draw. (The current game does not count toward
        the match result.)
    •   Single-elimination rounds: If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and both
        players have the same number of game wins and the same lore, the match continues until one
        player has more lore than the other. Once this happens, the player with the highest lore wins the
        game immediately.

3.5 Concessions and Intentional Draws

A player may concede an incomplete game at any time. That player immediately loses the game and, if
applicable, the match moves on to the next game.

A player who refuses to play a match is considered to have conceded that match.

                                                     6
Players may not ask their opponents to concede a game. Players may not implicitly or explicitly, offer or
accept any reward or consideration in exchange for a concession. Players provided such an offer are
required to call a judge and report the offer.

Prior to the end of a match, players may agree to draw the match. A player may only request an
intentional draw once per match, and may not implicitly or explicitly offer any reward or consideration in
exchange for a draw. Players provided such an offer are required to call a judge and report the offer.

3.4 Deck Registration

Players in Competitive Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are required to register their decks.

For a Constructed tournament, players must submit their deck list either via www.Melee.gg or on a
paper deck list, per instructions from the Tournament Organizer or Head Judge. The Tournament
Organizer will communicate the deck list submission deadline. If no such deadline is communicated, the
deck lists will be due before the first round is created.

For a Limited tournament, players will fill out a deck list as part of deck construction. These deck lists will
be provided to a Tournament Official by the end of deck construction.

Players may request to see their deck list between matches. These requests will be granted whenever
feasible.

Deck lists are considered the ultimate arbiter of which cards the player intended to play. Players must
take care to use complete card names, since many character cards have similar names.

3.6 Deck Checks

Judges at Competitive tournaments will perform deck checks as much as is feasible. Decks should be
checked after shuffling has completed but before opening hands are drawn. Deck checks are intended to
verify that players are playing the correct deck as registered on their deck list.

3.7 Dropping from a Tournament

A player may drop from the tournament at any time. Players are responsible for either dropping
themselves using Melee.gg or by informing a Judge or Scorekeeper. If the player is currently paired for
any matches when the request to drop is made, that player is considered to have conceded all games in
that match. Players who do not show up for their match will be dropped from the tournament unless
they inform the Scorekeeper before that round ends.

If a player drops during a Limited tournament, they keep all cards provided to them to by the
tournament organizer to participate in the event. This includes opened and partially drafted booster
packs.



Section 4: Information and Communication

4.1 Written Notes

Players are encouraged to keep written track of lore totals, but no other written notes are permitted.
Referring to outside notes during a match is considered Outside Assistance.

                                                       7
Players must not take notes during drafting.

4.2 Electronic Devices

At Casual tournaments, players may use the Disney Lorcana TCG Companion app for tracking lore and
referring to the card catalog as long as any references are made in a timely manner.

At Competitive tournaments, electronic devices capable of long-term data storage and/or internet access
are not permitted.

4.3 In-Game Information

During games, players are expected to communicate openly with their opponents.

When adding a card to their inkwell through the normal once-per-turn action, the player adding the card
must ensure that their opponent has full knowledge of which card is being added, including by
announcing the name of the card. The opponent must be allowed to verify that the card has the inkwell
symbol around the cost.

The current status of any card in play (exerted or ready, damage marked, whether the card’s ink is dry,
etc.) must be completely and correctly communicated by that card’s player whenever requested by
another player.

When a player has multiple simultaneous actions to resolve, that player must announce the order of
resolution before beginning to resolve the first one. The order cannot change once the first action has
begun.

Exerted cards should be rotated ninety degrees clockwise to indicate their status. Ready cards should be
upright. A player may choose to exert their cards in the counterclockwise direction if they choose, but
they should be consistent with all of their cards.

Lore gains must always be announced and must include the new lore total after the lore increase for that
player. This ensures that both players fully understand the current lore score and that any discrepancies
can be found and remedied as soon as possible, likely with the help of a Judge.

Players are expected to maintain a clear game state whenever possible. This includes pointing out
mandatory effects whenever they occur, even if they are from an opponent’s card. For purposes of this
rule, a “mandatory effect” is one that does not include the word “may” in its text. Failing to remind a
player of a “may” effect is not against the rules, but players are encouraged to remind their opponents of
these effects in order to foster the most positive play experience for all involved.

4.4 Inkwell

Players are required to keep their inkwell cards distinct and separate from any other facedown cards that
may be on the table. If there is ever any confusion about which cards are in a player’s inkwell, the players
should call a judge immediately so the error can be remedied. Additionally, all ready cards in a player’s
inkwell must be oriented in the same direction as each other; the same must also be true for exerted
cards in that player’s inkwell.



Section 5: Constructed Tournament Formats

                                                     8
5.1 Constructed Overview

“Constructed” describes any event where players are expected to build their decks ahead of time.
Currently, there is only one Constructed format, Core, but more may be added in future updates.

Constructed decks must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size, but a player must be
able to shuffle their deck in a timely manner without assistance.

Constructed decks must not contain cards from more than two ink colors. For example, if a deck contains
Amber and Amethyst cards, it must not contain any Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, or Steel cards.

Constructed decks must not contain more than four of a single card as identified by its full English card
name. Character cards with different subtitles are considered different cards for purposes of this rule.
For example, a deck may contain up to four copies of Ariel – On Human Legs as well as up to four copies
of Ariel – Spectacular Singer.



Section 6: Limited Tournament Formats

6.1 Limited Overview

“Limited” describes any event where players are provided with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product
and are expected to build their decks on site during the tournament. There are three Limited formats:
Sealed, Preconstructed, and Draft.

Limited decks in Sealed and Draft must contain at least 40 cards. There is no maximum deck size, except
that decks are limited in size by the card pool they are built from.

Limited decks are not restricted in how many ink types they may contain.

Limited decks may contain any number of copies of any individual card. For example, if a player in a
Sealed tournament opens six copies of Genie – The Ever Impressive, they may play all six in their deck.

6.2 Sealed

In a Sealed tournament, each player is provided with a set of unopened booster packs from which they
will build their deck.

The minimum number of boosters to be provided for Sealed tournaments is six packs per player, from
the set(s) of the tournament organizer's choice. Each player begins with the same number of boosters
from each set selected.

6.3 Preconstructed

In a Preconstructed tournament, players are provided with a random starter deck from the set chosen
for the tournament. Players may add or exchange any number of cards between the preconstructed deck
and the booster pack included in their starter deck product. Since the provided preconstructed deck
starts at 60 cards, the deck must be a minimum of 60 cards after the deck construction period. Limited-
format decks may contain cards of more than two inks.

Preconstructed events are only Casual tournaments.


                                                    9
6.4 Draft

In a Draft tournament, players take turns selecting, or “drafting,” cards from previously unopened
booster packs to form their card pools.

The minimum number of boosters to be provided for Draft tournaments is four packs per player, from
the set(s) of the tournament organizer's choice. Each player begins with the same number of boosters
from each set selected.

Players are seated into random groups of people, these groups are called pods. The number of people in
each pod is at the discretion of the head judge, although these guidelines should usually be followed:


    •   Each pod should have as close to eight players as possible
    •   No pod should have five or fewer players
    •   There should be no more than one pod with an uneven number of players.

    Following these guidelines, here are the recommended pod sizes for smaller tournaments:


            # of Players    Pods
            6-11            1 pod
            12-14           1 pod of 6
                            1 pod of 6 to 8
            15-17           1 pod of 8
            18              3 pods of 6
            19-20           2 pods of 6
                            1 pod of 7 or 8
            21              Pod of 6
                            Pod of 7
                            Pod of 8
            22              Pod of 6
                            2 pods of 8
            23              Pod of 7
                            2 pods of 8



For the first pack, each player opens the pack, selects one card to add to their card pool, then passes the
remaining cards to their left. Then they collect the pack from their right, select a card, and pass the
remaining cards to their left. Card selection continues in this manner until all cards from the pack have
been drafted. The direction of passing reverses for each pack: the second pack is passed to the right, the
third pack is passed to the left, and so on. Once all packs have been drafted, each player’s picks become
their completed card pool for deck construction.

In Casual Draft tournaments, players may be paired against any other player in the tournament.

In Competitive Draft tournaments, players must be paired against players in their own pod.



                                                    10
Section 7: Time Limits

7.1 General Tournament Time Limits

The time limit for a Swiss round is 50 minutes.

It is recommended that all matches in single-elimination rounds are untimed. If a time limit must be
imposed due to venue availability constraints, the time limit should be at least 50 minutes and should be
announced prior to the beginning of the single-elimination portion of the event.

If all matches have finished before the time limit is up in a round, the Head Judge may choose to start
the next round early. No players should be issued a Tardiness penalty if they arrive before the previous
round would have ended.

7.2 Limited Tournament Time Limits

The time limit for Sealed deck construction is 30 minutes.

The time limit for Sealed deck pool registration is 20 minutes.

The time limit for Preconstructed deck construction is 10 minutes.

The time limit for Draft deck construction and registration is 25 minutes.

The timing for individual Draft picks, if being used, is as follows:

    •   12 cards remaining: 30 seconds
    •   11 cards remaining: 25 seconds
    •   10 cards remaining: 25 seconds
    •   9 cards remaining: 20 seconds
    •   8 cards remaining: 20 seconds
    •   7 cards remaining: 15 seconds
    •   6 cards remaining: 10 seconds
    •   5 cards remaining: 10 seconds
    •   4 cards remaining: 5 seconds
    •   3 cards remaining: 4 seconds
    •   2 cards remaining: 3 seconds
