          Disney Lorcana TCG Organized Play Diversity & Inclusion Policy
          Effective Aug 17, 2023

          Ravensburger is devoted to curating an inviting, secure, and enjoyable atmosphere for
          everyone involved in Disney Lorcana TCG Organized Play. We champion diversity and
          inclusivity in all aspects of our programs and recognize that our gaming community is
          stronger when it respects and embraces diversity in all its forms.

          Our vision of “Fair Play” extends beyond the game. We expect every Participant—
          whether a player, store owner, staff member, contractor, judge, reporter, blogger, or
          spectator—to uphold this commitment. As a Participant in Disney Lorcana TCG
          Organized Play, you are agreeing to:

                • Consistently foster an environment that encourages engagement and
                participation from all
                • Avoid and actively challenge behavior that is demeaning, threatening, bullying,
                or harassing
                • Stand against discrimination in our events and associated activities, such as
                social media posts, blogging, and reporting. Discrimination can occur on various
                grounds, including but not limited to:

                       • Age
                       • Disability
                       • Family and parental status
                       • Gender identity
                       • Health status
                       • Political affiliation
                       • Race, color, ethnicity, nationality, language, or citizenship
                       • Religion
                       • Sexual orientation
                       • Veteran status

          We, along with all Participants, are committed to:

                • Addressing observed behaviors inconsistent with our ideals, actively seeking
                appropriate support, and persisting until the issue is resolved.
                • Approaching diversity and inclusion with grace, patience, thoughtfulness, open-
                mindedness, and steadfast resolve.

          By upholding these principles, we believe we can create a more diverse, inclusive, and
          enjoyable gaming experience for all involved in Disney Lorcana TCG Organized Play.
