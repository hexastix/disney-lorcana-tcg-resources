[Core Operations, Rules, and Enforcement]
Introduction
At its core, the Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game is a celebration of beloved Disney stories and
the players who bring them to life on the table. Fan-favorite characters, called glimmers, go on
quests to collect lore and slow down opponents by challenging their characters. This immersive
experience combines collectible cards, strategic deck building, and a fun and accessible
experience to create a unique game that brings fans of Disney and trading card games together.
Players may want to take part in a more organized method of playing Disney Lorcana TCG
through events, whether at a local game store or in an official Disney Lorcana TCG event. These
events, while still fun and social, require an individual to help guide players through some of the
more complex interactions they may face during play. These individuals are known as Lore
Guides in Disney Lorcana TCG. These passionate members of our community ensure that the
Disney Lorcana Organized Play system is held to the same standards across all events, and all
players feel welcome.
The Core Operations, Rules and Enforcement, or CORE document, provides basic information
on what it means to be a Lore Guide. It includes general philosophy as well as common
situations that may happen at events, and how to handle them. As a Lore Guide, you are the
link between the global community of players and the way to play the game. You are uniquely
positioned to bolster the game through kind expertise, engaging compassion, and bringing a
sense of infectious fun to the events you assist. You will likely be a player’s first experience in
dealing with the official Organized Play system of Disney Lorcana TCG, and it’s easy for a player
to feel anxious or intimidated by the prospect of interacting with an official.


   1. General Information
There are three tournament levels in Disney Lorcana TCG—Entry-level, Competitive, and
Premier. A player’s first introduction to the game will likely be during an Entry-level tournament
such as local League play or a Prerelease. These tournaments should prioritize fun, fair, and
light competition where players of all ages and skill levels are welcome. Mistakes are expected,
and the rules should be tools to help players out, rather than barriers to an enjoyable
experience.
The CORE Document will focus primarily on Entry-level tournaments. Empathy and education
are paramount, not penalties, and the role of a Lore Guide for an Entry-level event is to help
broaden players’ understanding of the rules while maintaining that welcoming space.
Some examples of Entry-level tournaments are those held at your local game store (LGS), at
conventions, or some side events at larger Competitive or Premier tournaments. Entry-level
tournaments are generally smaller in player count, and feature players of all experience levels.
Normally, prizing is smaller than competitive tournaments, and fewer rounds are played. Entry-
level tournaments are perfect for a quick, easy, and fun way to play Disney Lorcana for all to
enjoy, and as Lore Guides, you will help make that happen.
Competitive and Premier level events represent the higher levels of competition, from set
championships to the Challenge Series, and the World Championship. Players are held to a
higher standard at these tournaments. The emphasis is on technically correct play, and while
education and enjoyment for the players are still priorities, there is an added level of strict
adherence to the rules and policies. As such, a different document is used to determine the
correct error and remedy during a game: the Play Correction Guidelines. The Play Correction
Guidelines (PCG) document is available on the Disney Lorcana TCG Resources page, found here.
Remember that being a Lore Guide at local levels has its own challenges. Sometimes the store
will have unique formats for their specific communities, or perhaps they will have some
stipulations on how they want their tournaments to operate. Sometimes you will have to bridge
the gap between tournament organizers and the players. Ensure you explain to the group of
players at your event any changes to rules or needs of the environment during announcements
before play starts.
Regardless of what level you are a Lore Guide at, the following sections on general guidelines
and tips for being a Lore Guide are sure to help you wherever you may find yourself!


2. Common Situations and How to Handle Them
Below are some common examples of situations players may need assistance with at Disney
Lorcana TCG tournaments. Keep in mind, you should always refer to the Tournament Rules and
Play Correction Guidelines for guidance on how to apply fixes to a game.

Forgotten Actions or Steps
Example: A player forgets to ready their characters before starting to take game actions.

Philosophy: We’ve all been there, sometimes we get deep into the tank of strategy, and we
forget to do something we’re supposed to, like ready our ink or gain lore from a location. These
are common mistakes and relatively simple to fix as well, so the focus here should be to
educate the player and reinforce good habits, not coming down on them for improper play.

Fix: Gently remind them and let them complete the step or action as long as there is minimal
disruption. If more time has passed, adjust as needed to keep fairness, or leave the game as-is if
too much time has passed. Remember, players are allowed to take a series of actions that,
while not in the correct order, leads to the same legal game state as taking the actions in the
correct order would have led to. This is known as Out-of-Order Sequencing!
Miscounted Lore or Resources
Example: A player’s lore total is off by a few points. Maybe a player forgot to announce a lore
gain from an earlier quest or from a location, and only one player marked the lore change.

Philosophy: This is a common error. Typically, it comes from misreading the number of lore
gained and results in totals slightly higher or lower than they should be.

Fix: Try to determine the correct number before going in for a fix—working backward through
the turn can help here. Once you have found the source of the discrepancy, correct the total.
Encourage players to keep track openly and communicate constantly during the game to avoid
confusion. Remind players that lore changes should always be announced for the benefit of
both players and that it is part of the rules of the game!

Deck Problems
Example: A player shows up with 59 cards in a Constructed deck, 39 cards in a Sealed deck, puts
in cards that aren't legal for the format, or accidentally runs 5 copies of a card instead of the
usual 4.

Philosophy: Deck issues happen often. Maybe a card got left in the deck box, two decks got
mixed up during testing, or someone just didn’t know the construction rules. These slip-ups are
almost always unintentional, and they shouldn’t keep a player from enjoying their match. The
goal is simply to get the deck back into legal shape so the game can go on—and at the same
time, give the player a quick reminder of the correct deck-building requirements.

Fix: First, remove any cards that make the deck illegal (extra copies, off-format cards, and so
on). If that leaves the deck below the format requirements, the player needs to add legal cards
until it meets the minimum size. Once that’s done, check that both players are good to
continue. Encourage the player to take a moment before the next round to double-check their
deck so the same issue doesn’t come up again.

Incorrect number of cards in hand
Example: A player draws 8 cards at the start of the game or accidentally only draws 1 from an
effect when they should have drawn 2.

Philosophy: Every once in a while, players might draw the incorrect number of cards due to a
dexterity issue or misremembering how many cards an effect was supposed to make them
draw. While this should not be punished harshly, the advantage gained from additional cards
should be mitigated.

Fix: If the extra cards are known to both players, return those specific cards to the appropriate
zone. If not, then calculate how many extra cards the player has, take that number of cards
from their hand at random, and put those cards back into the appropriate zone. If a player was
supposed to draw or discard any cards, and they did not, those players should draw or discard
cards now.

Missed Triggers
Example: A player forgets to draw a card from the ability when Kuzco – Wanted Llama is
banished.

Philosophy: Given that triggered abilities are “invisible,” they are easily missed. Players will
often claim that it’s too late to trigger an ability that was forgotten. Given that education is the
focus at Entry-level tournaments, if the missed triggered ability is noticed within a reasonable
amount of time and resolving it now would not be too disruptive for the game, that’s the
preferred choice of action.

Fix: If the missed triggered ability was noticed before the controlling player started their next
turn and it would not be too disruptive to resolve it now, add it to the bag. Remind players that
triggers with “may” would normally be presumed to be declined and they should take care to
remember their triggers at future events.

Communication Mix-ups
Example: Players accidentally confuse which card is exerted or a player is asked how many
cards are in hand, and they absently minded reply “four” when they have five cards in hand.

Philosophy: Disney Lorcana TCG is not just a trading card game, it’s a game between people
occurring in person in real time. As such, communication mishaps are bound to come up. It’s
helpful to encourage clear communication by using the correct game terminology and remind
players to actively describe how they are playing to make the game state as clear as possible for
all players involved.

Fix: Help clarify the game state calmly and suggest clear communication, like speaking actions
out loud or physically pointing to cards.

General Errors
Example: A player plays a card without paying the full ink cost. Perhaps they thought they were
playing another card with a different cost or miscounted the ink they were exerting.

Philosophy: This will cover the bulk of the interactions you’re likely to see. Always look and see
what is currently wrong and think about whether it’s better to leave the game as-is after fixing
the error or rewinding through the decisions to the point of the error. Most of the time, it’ll be
more correct and less disruptive to leave as-is. Certain errors caught in enough time can easily
be rewound, and the players will be allowed to continue from the more correct game state. In
any case, we’re always looking to fix the error in the least disruptive way possible.
Fix: If caught quickly, reverse the play and guide them to pay the proper cost. If it’s too late,
adjust the game state as fairly as possible and explain.


3. Unacceptable Behavior
Problems like cheating or disruptive behavior can arise even at Entry-level tournaments. While
you should always approach any such cases with the general philosophy of empathy and
education first, you might need to take swift action to preserve a friendly and fair environment,
including removing players from the tournament and/or the venue. Always involve the
tournament organizer or store manager in such situations.

The following are examples of actions that will not be tolerated in any Disney Lorcana TCG
events:

   •   Aggressive, malicious, or harassing behavior towards any player(s) or a group of people
       (Unsporting Conduct)
   •   Intentionally mispresenting the game state or the rules of the game, or lying, to gain an
       advantage (Cheating).
   •   Betting on the outcomes of games, tournaments, or any other function of a Disney
       Lorcana TCG event (Wagering).
   •   Intentionally misrepresenting a game or match result. This doesn’t have to be in the
       offending player’s favor (Improper Match Result).

If a player is removed from the tournament or the venue for any of these actions, it is known as
a Disqualification, and the situation should be reported to Ravensburger.

   •   Fill out the official Disney Lorcana TCG Tournament Disqualification Form.
   •   If you have additional information you would like to provide that is not covered within
       the above form, please send an email to disqualifications@ravensburger.com.


4. Tips for Being a Lore Guide at All Levels
Being a Lore Guide at all levels requires patience, empathy, and understanding for not only the
rules of the game but the players as well. Balancing between a firm, yet gentle stance is key to
improving all players’ enjoyment and understanding of the game. In Competitive and Premier
levels, we expect players to have a firmer grasp of the rules and gameplay, but mistakes can
and do still happen. Other than the unacceptable behaviors above, ensuring gameplay is done
fairly and within the guidance of our rules is how we want to proceed.

Here are some tips on how to approach Lore Guide situations:
•   Approach with kindness – Players, especially in Entry-level tournaments, may be
    nervous to call for a Lore Guide even for simple mistakes or questions. When a table
    calls for assistance, you should approach by simply greeting the players. Ask how you
    can help them, making it clear that you are there to support both players and resolve
    the issue at hand.
•   Be patient – Take the time to allow players to explain the situation to you fully instead
    of jumping to conclusions. This will allow you to provide the correct response politely.
•   Take your time – As with the above, taking your time will help in the long run. If you are
    not clear on a ruling, take the time to go back and review the rules to ensure you have
    made the right call. If possible, seek help from a fellow Lore Guide as well!
•   Be firm – There will be times in which the right call doesn’t always feel good to make,
    however it's important to apply the rules consistently. You must be firm with your
    rulings and, if possible, show the references in the rules documents to defuse the
    situation. In case of disagreements, remain calm and be respectful, ensuring the players
    understand that you're in the event to help and maintain a fun fair environment for
    everyone.
•   Give extra time – when you take a Lore Guide call you should always try to give an
    extension if the call took at least a minute to answer. Rounding up to the nearest
    minute and maybe adding an extra on top so players can resituate themselves will help
    them not feel the pressure of the clock or feel that they “wasted” playtime by calling for
    a Lore Guide.
•   Speak loudly and clearly – Practice speaking loudly at home and bring that voice to your
    event when making announcements like how much time is left in the round, player
    meeting calls, or trying to find someone who didn’t report their result! Your voice needs
    to be heard over the din of players at the event. Remember, diaphragm, not throat!
•   Engage! – Being a part of the local community and helping stores with their events is
    also a great time to engage with players to help create fun, comfortable, and safe events
    for all players! Talk with players, enjoy their ups, and sympathize with their downs.
    Whether we’re Lore Guide's, players, TOs, or spectators, we all have one thing in
    common: this wonderful game we love to play. You have a unique opportunity to build
    up your community, so don’t be afraid to connect with every type of participant at an
    event!
