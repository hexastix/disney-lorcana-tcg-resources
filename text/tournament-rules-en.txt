SECTION 1: TOURNAMENT DEFINITIONS

1.1 Tournament Types

Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two types:

Constructed Tournaments – played with decks that the players have built before the tournament
begins. Each player is responsible for bringing a deck that is legal for the specific Constructed
format being played at that tournament (See Section 1.3.1, “Constructed Tournament Formats.”).

Limited Tournaments – Played with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product that is provided by the
Tournament Organizer. Players aren’t expected to bring any Disney Lorcana TCG cards with them
to participate in a Limited tournament. Limited includes the Preconstructed, Sealed, Pack Rush
and Draft variants (See Section 1.3.1, “Limited Tournament Formats.”).

1.2 Tournament Levels

Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into three levels: Casual, Competitive, and Premier
Play. All tournaments handle in-game errors by using the Disney Lorcana TCG Play Correction
Guidelines, available on the Disney Lorcana TCG Resources page, found here.

Casual tournaments are played with more relaxed rules and fewer, if any, prizes. These
tournaments are intended for less serious play; Tournament Organizers are responsible for
ensuring that these events are welcoming to less-experienced players. The focus of Casual
tournaments is to be fun and educational for all. Prerelease events are examples of Casual
tournaments.

Competitive tournaments are designed for more serious play, featuring stricter rules and higher
expectations for players. They also feature unique and sometimes significant prizes for players.
Because of this higher standard, players are expected to be familiar with the rules and policies in
this document. Some Corrective Actions from the Play Correction Guidelines are also modified at
this level. Set Championships are examples of Competitive tournaments.

Premier Play tournaments are the highest level of Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments. The focus of
these events is competition, and players can win significant prizes. Players are expected to
understand the rules and policies outlined in this document, as well as the full Play Correction
Guidelines, due to this higher level of competition. Challenge Events and World Championships
are examples of Premier Play tournaments.

1.3 Tournament Formats

1.3.1 Constructed Tournament Formats

“Constructed” describes any event where players are expected to build their decks ahead of the
tournament. There are two constructed formats: Core and Infinity.

1.3.1.1 Core Constructed

   •   Constructed decks must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size, but a
       player must be able to shuffle their deck in a timely manner without assistance.
   •   Constructed decks must not contain cards from more than two ink colors. For example, if a
       deck contains Amber and Amethyst cards, it must not contain any Emerald, Ruby,
       Sapphire, or Steel cards. Decks may contain dual-ink cards, so long as they contain both
       the two primary ink colors in a deck.
   •   Constructed decks must not contain more than four of a single card identified by its full
       English card name. Cards with different subtitles are considered distinct cards for the
       purpose of this rule. For example, a deck may contain up to four copies of Ariel – On Human
       Legs as well as up to four copies of Airel – Spectacular Singer.
   •   In a Core Constructed tournament, players may only use cards that are within the current
       rotation schedule to build their decks.
   •   In a Core Constructed tournament, players may not use any cards that are banned from the
       Core Constructed format (See Section 1.6.2 “Banned Cards”).

1.3.1.2 Infinity Constructed

   •   Infinity Constructed tournaments follow the same guidelines as Core Constructed
       tournaments with the following exception:
           o     In Infinity Constructed tournaments, players may use any cards from any set, so
                 long as they follow the other guidelines within this section (See Section 1.3.1
                 “Constructed Tournament Formats”).
           o     Infinity Constructed tournaments will feature their own banned card list that is
                 separate from Core Constructed tournaments (See Section 1.6.2 “Banned Cards”).




1.3.2 Limited Tournament Formats

“Limited” describes any event where players are provided with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG
product and are expected to build their decks on-site during the tournament. There are four Limited
formats: Sealed, Preconstructed, Pack Rush, and Draft.

   •   Limited decks in Sealed and Draft must contain at least 40 cards. There is no maximum
       deck size, except that decks are limited in size by the card pool they’re built from.
   •   Limited decks aren’t restricted in how many ink types they may contain.
   •   Limited decks may contain any number of copies of any individual card. For example, if a
       player in a Sealed tournament opens six copies of Genie – The Ever Impressive, they may
       play all six in their deck.

1.3.2.1 Preconstructed

   •   In a Preconstructed tournament, players are provided with a random starter deck from the
       set or sets chosen for the tournament. At the Tournament Organizer’s discretion, players
       may add or exchange any number of cards between the preconstructed deck, the booster
       pack included in their starter deck box, and/or any additional sealed product supplied for
       the construction of the deck. Since the provided preconstructed deck is 60 cards, the deck
       must be a minimum of 60 cards after the deck construction period. Limited-format decks
       may contain cards of more than two inks.
   •   Preconstructed events are only Casual tournaments.

1.3.2.2 Sealed

   •   In a Sealed tournament, each player is provided with a set of unopened booster packs from
       which they will build their deck. The minimum number of booster packs to be provided for
       Sealed tournaments is six per player, from the set(s) of the Tournament Organizer’s choice.
       Each player begins with the same number of booster packs from each set selected.
   •   Sealed tournaments may be used at any tournament level.

1.3.2.3 Pack Rush

   •   In a Pack Rush tournament, players are provided with two unopened booster packs, either
       from the same set or from different sets, from which they will build their deck. Players will
       remove the marketing or puzzle cards from the packs and shuffle all the remaining cards
       from the two booster packs together to form a 24-card deck, with no ink color restrictions.
   •   All players should follow the remaining guidelines found on the Disney Lorcana TCG
       Resources page, Pack Rush Rules found here.

1.3.2.4 Draft

   •   In a Draft tournament, players take turns selecting, or “drafting”, cards from unopened
       booster packs to form their card pools.
   •   The minimum number of booster packs to be provided for Draft tournaments is four per
       player, from the set(s) of the Tournament Organizer’s choice. Each player begins with the
       same number of booster packs from each set selected.
   •   Players are seated in random groups called pods. The number of people in each pod is at
       the discretion of the Tournament Organizer, although these guidelines should usually be
       followed:
            o Each pod should have as close to eight players as possible.
            o Each pod should have at least six players.
            o There should be no more than one pod with an uneven number of players.
   •   Following these guidelines, here are the recommended pod sizes for smaller tournaments:

                               # of players                Pods
                                   6-11                    1 pod
                                  12-14                 1 pod of 6
                                                      1 pod of 6 to 8
                                  15-16                 1 pod of 8
                                                      1 pod of 7 to 8
                                    17                  1 pod of 8
                                                        1 pod of 9
                                   18                   3 pods of 6
                                  19-20                 2 pods of 6
                                                      1 pod of 7 to 8
                                    21                  1 Pod of 6
                                                        1 Pod of 7
                                                        1 Pod of 8
                                    22                  1 Pod of 6
                                                        2 Pods of 8
                                    23                  1 Pod of 7
                                                        2 Pods of 8
   •   For the first booster pack, each player opens a pack, selects one card to add to their card
       pool, and then passes the remaining cards to their left. Then, they collect the cards passed
       from their right, select a card, and pass the remaining cards to their left. Card selection
       continues in this manner until all cards from the pack have been drafted.
   •   The direction of the passing reverses for each pack after the first: cards from the second
       pack are passed to the right, cards from the third pack are passed to the left, and so on.
       Once all packs have been drafted, each player’s picks become their card pool for deck
       construction.
   •   In Casual Draft tournaments, players may be paired against any other player in the
       tournament.
   •   In Competitive Draft tournaments, players must be paired against players in their own pod.
   •   Tournament Organizer’s may create special deck construction rules for specific events at
       competitive-level events. These rules must be communicated to players in a timely manner
       prior to the start of the tournament.



1.4 Tournament Roles
Tournaments may have multiple roles represented:

   •   Tournament Organizer
   •   Head Judge
   •   Floor Judge
   •   Scorekeeper
   •   Player
   •   Spectator
   •   Broadcast Representative

All the above roles except Player and Spectator are considered Tournament Officials. For purposes
of this document, “Judge” refers to anyone acting as Head Judge or Floor Judge in that tournament,
unless specifically named.

1.5 Eligible Players and Tournament Officials

Anyone is eligible to play in any Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the following exceptions:

   •   Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events.
   •   Any Tournament Official for any event they are a part of (Competitive and Premier Play
       only).
   •   Any individuals specifically prohibited from participation by Ravensburger North America
       Organized Play policy. It ensures fair play, transparency, and mitigates conflicts of interest
       within competitive events.

Anyone is eligible to serve as a Tournament Official for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the
following exceptions:

   •   Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events.
    •   Anyone who has played in the tournament that they want to be a Tournament Official for,
        even if that person has dropped out of the tournament.

Tournament Officials are allowed to participate in Casual-level events. Tournament Officials are
prohibited from participating in Competitive and Premier Play-level events, including Set
Championships and Challenges, for which they are serving as a Tournament Official.

1.6 Set Legality and Rotation

Disney Lorcana TCG sets are legal to play in Disney Lorcana TCG Sanctioned Constructed
Tournaments immediately on pre-release in hobby stores and are legal to play in Disney Lorcana
TCG Sanctioned Limited Tournaments immediately on pre-release in hobby stores. Alternate and
special versions of cards, including preview and promo cards, become legal when their respective
set does, regardless of when they’re released.



To maintain a dynamic and balanced competition circuit, Core Constructed tournaments will
follow a rotation schedule that phases out older sets in a structed cadence.

Only cards from currently legal sets will be permitted in Core Constructed events. Players are
responsible for ensuring their decks comply with the current rotation status at the time of the
event. For the avoidance of doubt, any set(s) that have rotated out of Core Constructed are no
longer legal for Core Constructed tournaments.

Any version of a card can be used in the format for which the card is currently legal if the full name
is matched completely. For example, if a card is from a set that is legal in Core Constructed, any
version of that card from current or previous sets can be used in Core Constructed.

Alternate and special versions of cards, including preview and promo cards, rotate when their
respective sets do.

1.6.1 Rotation list

    •   With the release of Set 9, only cards released in Sets 5 and later are legal to use in Core
        Constructed. The following sets will rotate out of Core Constructed:
           o Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, and Set 4.
    •   With the release of Set 13, only cards released in Sets 9 and later are legal to use in Core
        Constructed. The following sets will rotate out of Core Constructed:
           o Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, Set 4, Set 5, Set 6, Set 7, and Set 8.

Additional rotations will be added in future updates to the Tournament Rules. Set Rotation does not
apply to Infinity Constructed tournaments.

1.6.2 Banned Cards

The following cards are banned in Core Constructed Tournaments:
    •   Hiram Flaversham – Toymaker
    •   Forisphere

The following cards are banned in Infinity Constructed Tournaments:

    •   None

Cards that are banned in Infinity Constructed Tournaments will be added to this section in future
updates to the Tournament Rules.



SECTION 2: TOURNAMENT ROLES

2.1 Tournament Organizer

The Tournament Organizer for a Disney Lorcana TCG Tournament is responsible for several tasks,
including but not limited to:

    •   Obtaining permission from Ravensburger to operate the tournament.
    •   Providing and furnishing a sufficient site to operate the tournament.
    •   Promoting the tournament to ensure sufficient attendance.
    •   Advertising the tournament type and format for player preparation.
    •   Acquiring sufficient staff for the tournament (e.g., Judges and Scorekeepers).
    •   Providing sufficient materials to operate the tournament (e.g., product in a Limited
        tournament).
    •   Reporting the tournament results to Ravensburger, if requested.

2.2 Head Judge

Every Disney Lorcana TCG tournament must have a Tournament Organizer designate a Head Judge
for that event. This person must be physically present throughout the duration of the event. For
Casual tournaments, the Tournament Organizer may serve as the Head Judge. For Competitive and
Premier Play tournaments, the Tournament Organizer and Head Judge must be two separate
individuals.

The Head Judge is the final arbiter for any rules or tournament policy disputes at a Disney Lorcana
TCG tournament. It’s their responsibility to enforce the codes in this document, the Disney Lorcana
TCG Comprehensive Rules, and the Disney Lorcana TCG Play Correction Guidelines. All
tournament participants are expected to abide by the Head Judge’s decisions.

For smaller tournaments, the Head Judge is typically the only judge required. For larger
tournaments, the Head Judge is expected to delegate tasks to other judges as necessary to
facilitate smooth tournament function and timely responses to player questions.

If a player is dissatisfied with a judge’s ruling, they may appeal the ruling to the Head Judge. The
Head Judge’s ruling is final.
In Competitive and Premier Play tournaments, if any player must be disqualified or otherwise
removed from a tournament, the Head Judge must write a report of the incident and submit it to
Ravensburger.

The Head Judge may, in rare and extraordinary circumstances, depart from the rules and policies
specified in this and any associated tournament rulebooks. The Head Judge alone has the authority
to make these modifications. These deviations from policy are intended to maintain the event’s
integrity, ensure equity, and address unforeseen or exceptional circumstances that are not
adequately addressed by current policies.

Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:

   •   During a match, a card or other game element is inadvertently destroyed or damaged. In
       this situation, the Head Judge may allow the use of a clearly identified proxy, which the
       Head Judge will supply and approve. Only Head Judges may issue proxies.

For Competitive and Premier Play tournaments, the Head Judge must write a report detailing the
incident, any deviations made, and submit it to Ravensburger, if requested.



2.3 Judge

Judges are responsible for assisting players with rules questions and resolving errors made during
play. They’re expected to be impartial and to avoid assisting players with in-game strategy. Judges
should not prevent play mistakes from happening but should instead only pause a match if an
illegal action is taken or if a situation requires de-escalation. Judges should hold themselves to a
high standard of sporting behavior and should exemplify this to players and spectators whenever
serving as a tournament official.

2.4 Scorekeeper

The Scorekeeper is responsible for recording all tournament results and generating all tournament
pairings. For smaller tournaments, this role may be served by the Tournament Organizer or a Judge.
This person should be familiar with the Ravensburger Play Hub so that any issues or errors can be
corrected in a timely manner and with minimal disruption to the tournament. If any egregious
tournament scorekeeping issues arise, the Head Judge is the final arbiter for determining the
appropriate action.

2.5 Player

Players in Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments have the following responsibilities:

   •   Always being respectful and courteous towards Tournament Officials, other players, and
       spectators.
   •   Always refraining from unsporting conduct.
   •   Arriving for the tournament and for all matches punctually.
    •   Supplying all required tournament materials, including an appropriate deck for Constructed
        tournaments. This can also include dice, a playmat, pen and paper, and non-marked card
        sleeves (See Section 3.10 “Approved Accessories”).
    •   For Competitive and Premier Play Constructed tournaments, submitting their deck list via
        the approved method given by the Tournament Organizer.
    •   Verifying that their match results are reported promptly and accurately.
    •   Properly communicating with their opponent to the best of their ability.
    •   Notifying Tournament Officials of any rules or policy violations observed during their own
        matches, or another player’s match as they occur.
    •   Abiding by the rules of this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Comprehensive Rules, the
        Disney Lorcana TCG Play Correction Guidelines, and all rulings made by Judges.

Any assistance given by a Judge does not remove these responsibilities.

2.6 Spectator

Spectators are expected to allow Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments to proceed unaffected by their
observation. Any person present at a Disney Lorcana TCG event who isn’t a Tournament Official or
actively participating in an in-progress match is considered a Spectator.

Spectators are expected to remain silent and unobtrusive while matches proceed. Spectators who
believe they have witnessed a rule or policy violation are encouraged to notify a Judge promptly. If a
spectator observes a rule violation, they should ask the players to pause their game while the
spectator notifies a Judge. The spectator should not reveal any details of the perceived violation to
the players but should instead relay the information to a Judge so that the situation can be
addressed correctly.

Players may always request that a spectator not observe their match. This request should involve a
Judge. Tournament Officials may always restrict the ability of spectators to observe matches.

For players who may require assistance to perform game actions or physically handle cards or
other game objects, a spectator can be designated to assist the player. These spectators can ask
simple questions to clarify the intent of the player but aren’t permitted to offer any kind of play or
strategic advice.

2.7 Broadcast Representative

Broadcast Representatives are responsible for overseeing all event coverage and content
production. They are responsible for running and overseeing the official event feed, recording
games and event footage, taking pictures of players, the event, the location, and handling all
livestreaming requests. Broadcast Representatives are required to follow all policies outlined in
Section 4 – Broadcast – of these Tournament Rules.

Broadcast Representatives may be present at all levels of tournaments but are most common at
the Premier Play level.
Ravensburger and its partners may use any media gathered by the Broadcast Representative for
editorial, marketing, or promotional purposes. Consent to be filmed, photographed, and recorded
in this way is implied by participation in the event in any tournament role.

Unlike matches that are not broadcast, broadcast matches could be subject to extra policies and
different procedures (such as longer preparation times for coverage, microphone or headset use,
and seating changes). Before the game, a member of the Judge team or the Broadcast
Representative will explain these changes to all parties. Players are expectedt o collaborate and
adhere to any broadcast-related instructions.



SECTION 3: TOURNAMENT OPERATIONS

3.1 Player Minimums

To qualify as an official Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, a minimum of eight players must
participate. The tournament is no longer formally approved by Ravensburger and should be
reported as canceled if at least eight participants are not present and prepared to compete.

Only officially recognized Ravensburger-approved tournaments, such as Prerelease events, Set
Championships, or authorized Tournament Organizer events, are subject to this requirement. This
requirement does not apply to informal events that are not part of these activities.

There must be a minimum of eight participants in any tournament labeled Competitive level or
higher.

3.2 Round Minimums

To qualify as an official Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, a minimum of three rounds must be
played. The tournament is no longer formally approved by Ravensburger and should be reported as
canceled if at least three rounds are not played.

Only officially recognized Ravensburger-approved tournaments, such as Prerelease events, Set
Championships, or authorized Tournament Organizer events, are subject to this requirement. This
requirement does not apply to informal events that are not part of these activities.

There must be a minimum of three rounds played in any tournament labeled Competitive level or
higher.

Additional rounds are added to tournaments with more players for better player experience. Based
on the number of players in the first round, the following number of rounds are advised to be
played:

Top Cut is only required for Competitive and Premier Play level tournaments.

3.3 Match Structure

Any Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments must follow the Match Structure guidelines for each type of
event listed below as follows:

   •   Casual and Competitive Play
          o Disney Lorcana TCG Casual and Competitive level tournaments may use a variety
              of match structures for their events. The match structures for these events are
              decided by the Tournament Organizer. Ravensburger encourages all Competitive
              level events with 64 players or above participating to use the Premier Play Match
              Structure below.
          o Note that some events, such as Set Championships, may have additional
              requirements for Match Structure in order to be considered a formally approved
              Ravensburger tournament.
          o Any Casual and Competitive level tournaments that use Best of Three (Bo3) are
              encouraged to follow the Premier Play Match Structure.
   •   Premier Play
          o Disney Lorcana TCG Premier Play tournaments are played using a Best of Three
              (Bo3). Players will play a series of games, up to a maximum of three – with the first
              player winning two games to be determined as the winner of the match.
          o Three (3) match points are awarded for each match victory. Zero (0) match points
              are awarded for each match loss. One (1) match point is awarded for each match
              draw.
                  ▪ Prior to the match beginning, and before any action has occurred in the
                      match, the two players in the match must randomly decide which player has
                      the choice of going first or drawing first.
                          • Any mutually agreed upon method may be used, such as rolling dice
                              or flipping a coin. If players cannot agree on a method, a Judge will
                              decide the method for the match.
                  ▪ The player who has been determined to make the decision will choose if
                      they go first or draw first in game one.
                          • The decision to play or draw in game one, or any game in a match,
                              must be made before either player sees their opening hand for that
                              game.
                           •    If a player is unable to decide, they are presumed to be going first in
                                game one.
                   ▪ The player who is first in each game does not draw a card at the start of their
                       first turn.
                   ▪ Once a game is completed, the player who lost the most recent game
                       chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of the match.
           o   In Disney Lorcana TCG Premier Play tournaments, there may be Single Elimination
               brackets played for top players at the event. For Single Elimination brackets,
               matches are played using a Best of Three (Bo3) format. To be awarded a victory for
               the match, a player must win two of the three games in the match.
                   ▪ Prior to the match beginning, and before any action has occurred in the
                       match, the player who is seeded higher from the Swiss Rounds will have the
                       choice of play or draw in game one.
                           •   Once a game is completed, the player who lost the most recent
                               game chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of the
                               match.
                           •   The decision to play or draw in each game must be made before
                               either player sees their opening hand for each game.
                           •    If a player is unable to decide, they are presumed to be going first in
                                the next game.
           o   Matches are recorded by the number of games won-lost-drawn. Any mutually
               agreed to draw games or unfinished games are always recorded as draws in the
               match. For example, a match where a player wins 2 games in a row is recorded as 2-
               0-0. A match where a player wins one game and time runs out in the round, if there
               is no winner in the End-of-round procedure, is recorded as a 1-0-1 in the player who
               wins one game’s favor.
                   ▪ Single-Elimination brackets may have different End-of Round Procedures.

3.4 Match Procedure
Pregame:

   •   Before a game begins, players will first decide which player is going first or drawing first as
       described in Section 3.3. Each player shuffles their deck. Then, each player offers their
       deck to their opponent, who then gets the opportunity to shuffle or cut the deck further.
       Once completed, each player draws their opening seven-card hand.
            For every game of a match, each player has the opportunity to alter their hand
               before any action has occurred. For a more detailed breakdown, please see the
               Comprehensive Ruleset, found here.
   •   Pile Counting
               Pile Counting is a method some players may use to verify the exact card count in
                their deck. In Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments, Pile Counting is permitted under
                the following conditions:
                    ▪ Must be done prior to shuffling
                    ▪ It may only be done before the start of each game, not during or after
                         gameplay has started. Pile Counting may only be done once per game.
                    ▪ Pile Counting must not be used to manipulate the deck in any way.
               Once the player finishes the Pile Count for the current upcoming game, they must
                shuffle their deck and give their opponent a chance to shuffle further or cut their
                deck.

Once this process has been completed, the first player begins their first turn. They will not draw a
card during their Start of Turn Phase for this turn. For a more detailed breakdown, please see the
Comprehensive Ruleset, found here.

End of Match:

At the conclusion of a match, it is the responsibility of both players to verify the match result and
make sure that it is appropriately reported to the Tournament Organizer using the approved
reporting method. This could be physical result slips or digital platforms such as the Ravensburger
Play Hub.

Before submitting, players must verify that the winner and the match outcomes (2-0-0, 2-1-0, 1-1-1,
0-0-3) are accurate. Both players should confirm the report with the Judge or Tournament Organizer
when requested.

The Tournament Organizer must be notified right away of any disputes or missing reports. Players
who do not accurately report a match's result could cause disruptions to the tournament, and
players may be issued penalties, including a match loss or disqualification.

When time is called in a round, any games still in progress will immediately proceed to the end-of-
match procedure, as follows:

   •   The active player finishes their turn.
             This is known as turn 0 and does not count towards the five total turns remaining in
                the game.
   •   After that turn, there are five total turns remaining in the game.
   •   Regardless of which player’s turn it is, every turn that is taken after the turn when time was
       called will count toward the five-turn total. This often converts to two turns for the active
       player when time is called and three turns for the inactive player.
   •   If the game ends during these turns, the match is reported in accordance with the normal
       rules.
   •   If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and one player has more game
       wins than the other, that player wins the match. Unfinished games are recorded as drawn
       games.
   •   Swiss Rounds: If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five, award match
       points as described in 3.3. The match is a draw if, at the end of turn five, neither player has
       won any games or if players have won an equal number of games.
   •   Single-Elimination Rounds: When time is called in the round, if a player has more game
       wins than their opponent, they win the match. If both players are tied for game wins, 5
       additional turns are played. A new game may be started if one is not in-progress to
       complete these 5 additional turns. If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five
       and both players have the same number of game wins, the player with the highest lore total
       wins the match. If the players have the same number of game wins and the same lore, the
       game continues until one player has more lore than the other. Once this happens, the
       player with the higher lore wins the game immediately.

3.5 Out-of-Order Sequencing

Players can take a series of actions that, while not in the correct order, arrive at the same legal
game state that would have been if the actions had been performed in the technically correct
order. This can’t be used to gain any kind of information from the opponent, any action taken out of
order can’t affect other actions in different ways depending on the order of operations, and all
actions taken must still be legal actions.

   •   Example, if a player exerts their ink before revealing the card they intend to play, while not
       the technically correct order, still arrives at the legal state of the card being played.
   •   However, if a player draws a card for turn while they have an effect in play that says, “At the
       start of your turn, discard a card,” and then tries to discard a card, Out-of-Order-
       Sequencing doesn’t apply here, as the action of discarding a card will affect a different set
       of cards depending on what order the actions are taken. In this example, corrective action
       may be appropriate.

Out-of-Order Sequencing does not cover any Missed Triggers policy.

3.6 Intentional Draws and Concessions

A player may concede an incomplete game or match at any time. That player immediately loses the
game and, if applicable, the match moves on to the next game.

A player who refuses to play a match is considered to have conceded that match.

Players can’t ask their opponents to concede a game. Players can’t implicitly or explicitly offer or
accept any reward or consideration in exchange for a concession. Players provided with such an
offer are required to call a judge and report the offer.
At any point prior to the end of a match, players may agree to intentionally draw (0-0-3) the match.
A player may request an intentional draw only once per match and can’t implicitly or explicitly offer
any reward or consideration in exchange for an intentional draw. Players provided such an offer are
required to call a judge and report the offer.

3.7 Deck Registration

Players in Competitive and Premier Play Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are required to register
their decks.

For a Constructed tournament, players must submit their deck list either via Ravensburger Play
Hub or on a paper deck list, following instructions from the Tournament Organizer. The Tournament
Organizer should communicate the deck list submission deadline. If no such deadline is
communicated, the deck lists will be due before the first round is created.

For a Limited tournament, players fill out a deck list as part of deck construction. These deck lists
must be provided to a Tournament Official by the end of deck construction. The Disney Lorcana
TCG Set Checklists can be found on the Disney Lorcana TCG Resources page, here.

Players may request to see their deck list between matches. These requests will be granted
whenever feasible.

Deck lists are considered the ultimate arbiter of which cards the player intended to play. Players
must take care to use full card names, since many character cards have similar names.

The use of official deck list forms is recommended for submitting a deck list, but it isn’t required.
The Disney Lorcana TCG Deck Registration Sheet can be found on the Disney Lorcana TCG
Resources page, here.

3.8 Deck Checks

Judges at Competitive and Premier Play tournaments will perform Deck Checks where possible.
After shuffling is completed and before players draw their opening hands, decks should be
examined. Deck Checks are intended to verify that players are playing the correct cards as
registered on their deck list.

For Competitive tournaments, Tournament Organizers are expected to check as many decks as
possible during the event. For Premier Play tournaments, at least 10% of decks are expected to be
checked and it is recommended that the Tournament Organizer check as many decks as possible
during the event.

Deck Checks may happen at any time during a tournament.

3.9 Dropping from a Tournament

A player may drop out of the tournament at any time. Players are responsible for either dropping
themselves using the Ravensburger Play Hub or by informing a Judge or Scorekeeper. If the player
is currently paired for any matches when the request to drop is made, that player is considered to
have conceded all games in that match. Players who don’t show up for their match will be dropped
from the tournament unless they inform the Judge or Scorekeeper before that round ends.

If a player drops during a Limited tournament, they keep all cards provided to them by the
Tournament Organizer to participate in the event. This includes opened and partially drafted
booster packs.

3.10 Approved Accessories

Players are allowed to use personal accessories during tournaments as long as they follow the
guidelines listed below. Accessories must not show offensive, graphic, or otherwise unsuitable
content. Images that are violent, sexually provocative, or discriminating in nature are not
permitted.

The Tournament Organizer may, at any time, approve or disapprove of any accessory and request a
player to use different accessories. Players may be given a match loss or disqualified from the
tournament for failing to comply with these guidelines.

Approved Accessories are:

   •   Playmats
            Officially licensed Disney Lorcana TCG Playmats OR any Playmat that follows the
              guidelines in Section 3.10.
            All playmats must be clean, rest flat on the table, and not interfere with gameplay.
   •   Deck Sleeves
            Officially licensed Disney Lorcana TCG Deck Sleeves OR any Deck Sleeves that

            Each sleeve must enclose a single card entirely.
              All sleeves must be the same size, color, and style.
              All sleeves must have fully opaque backs.

Inner or over sleeves are allowed, provided that all other rules for sleeves are followed, with the
exception of a fully opaque back. If sleeves need to be changed for a non-urgent issue that is found
during a match, Tournament Officials may allow the change to be made between games or after the
current match has concluded.

   •   Dice
             Officially licensed Disney Lorcana TCG Dice OR Dice that follow the guidelines in
              Section 3.10.
           Non-branded, polyhedral dice
           All dice must be in good condition and have easily identifiable numbers
   •   Lore Counters
            Officially licensed Disney Lorcana TCG Lore Counters
            Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game Companion app
            Custom Lore Counters may be used but must be an easily identifiable object and
             cannot be deceptive or confusing to players or Tournament Officials.
           Written methods may be used to track Lore, so long as it is approved using the
             guidelines in Section 5.2.
   •   Deck Boxes

               be used while gameplay is in progress, unless to access another approved
               accessory.
   •   Altered Artwork Cards
            Cards that feature any sort of altering on the card may only be used during Casual
               tournaments. These cards may not offer any competitive or strategic advantage,
               references to other trading card games or any unsuitable content, outlined above in
               this section.
              Competitive and Premier Play tournaments may only use unaltered, officially
               licensed Disney Lorcana TCG cards. Cards with signatures may still be used as long
               as they do not alter the artwork in any way and follow the guidelines in this ruleset.

3.11 Time Extensions

If a Tournament Official pauses a match for more than 1 minute while the round is being played,
they should issue the appropriate time extension equal to the time the match was paused. For
deck checks, the time extension should equal the time it took to perform the check plus three
minutes.



SECTION 4: BROADCAST

4.1 Tournament Operator Rights

The Tournament Organizer may work with Broadcast Representatives to televise, stream, film,
photograph, record, or broadcast any part of events outlined in this ruleset. The resulting content
may be used for any purpose, including but not limited to marketing and promoting the event, the
Tournament Organizer, Disney Lorcana TCG, or other events.

4.2 Player Likeness Consent

Players agree to allow Tournament Organizers and Broadcast Representatives to record, use, and
reproduce their name, likeness, voice, image, gameplay, and related marks or logos in any kind of
media by taking part in any event covered by this ruleset. Photography, video, audio, live or
recorded broadcast, and promotional materials in any format – digital or print – are included.

This consent will be used to promote the marketing and documentation of Disney Lorcana TCG
organized play, and it is valid globally.

For non-broadcast events or local tournaments, players can notify the Tournament Organizer or
Broadcast Representative before the event begins if they do not want to be photographed, filmed,
or recorded. Reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate such requests; however, players
may be limited in their participation in featured matches or other promotional opportunities.



SECTION 5: INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION

5.1 Game Layout

During all Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments, players are required to maintain a clear and
consistent Game Layout to support fair play and clarity for both players and Tournament Officials.

   •   Characters, items, and locations must be positioned in front of the player’s inkwell,
       meaning they are closer to the opponent than their own inkwell cards.
   •   Characters who have moved to locations should be clearly identified to be at the location
       they have moved to.
   •   A player’s inkwell does not need to be placed closest to the edge of the table; it may be
       positioned to the left, right, or further back in the play area, as long as characters, items and
       locations always appear in front of the inkwell from the opponent's perspective.
   •   Game Layout must remain clear and unambiguous throughout the game and not disrupt
       gameplay or lead to any uncertainty about the game’s current state.

As long as the Game Layout is clear and understandable to all players and Tournament Officials,
players who require additional accommodation due to age, disability, or other accessibility needs,
may adjust their Game Layout. If any accommodation is required, players are expected to request
assistance from a Tournament Official or Judge, who can assist in creating a clear and easily
accessible Game Layout.

5.2 Notes and Information Tracking

Players may use tokens to track only their own in-game, public information. Players are not allowed
to track any of their opponents' public or private information. This can include, but isn’t limited to,
using tokens to remember gaining location lore, or if a character can’t change its status to ready at
the start of next turn. Any type of numerical representation is prohibited from being on a token to
track any in-game information other than damage.

Players are encouraged to keep written track of lore totals, but they’re not permitted to take any
other form of notes during a match. Referring to outside notes during a match is considered
Outside Assistance. For more information on Outside Assistance, use the Disney Lorcana TCG Play
Correction Guidelines, available at the Disney Lorcana TCG Resources page, found here. This can
include, but isn’t limited to, writing down inkwell cards as they're revealed, using dice to denote the
ink costs of revealed cards, or using other devices or processes to create some type of record of
game information. A Tournament Official will make the final determination of whether a form of
note was made.

Players may not take or look at notes during Drafting or during Limited Deck Construction.

5.3 Electronic Devices

The use of electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets, smart watches (e.g., Apple Watch) at
Disney Lorcana TCG events is permitted so long as all devices are always in plain view of both
players competing in a match. Using the Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game Companion app for
tracking lore and referring to the card database are examples of allowed usage.

Players may use their electronic device for private reasons (such as texting, making a call or
browsing) after first informing a Judge, who will help facilitate the request. Penalties, such as
warnings, match loss, or disqualification from the tournament, will be given at the Judge’s
discretion for any player not following these guidelines or attempting to hide any device use.

5.4 In-Game Information

There are two types of information in Disney Lorcana TCG: public and private. Information is
considered private if it exists in any facedown zone. Although the hand isn’t a facedown zone, it’s
considered private information from your opponent. Information in any other zone is considered
public.

Players are allowed to know the status, characteristics, and contents of any public zone or of any
card in a public zone. Players are allowed to know only the number of cards in a private zone.

If private information is revealed to the opponent, it’s considered public information while
revealed. Players are responsible for maintaining private information from being revealed to other
players.

During games, players are expected to communicate openly with their opponents.

When adding a card to their inkwell through the standard once-per-turn action, the player adding
the card must ensure that their opponent has full knowledge of which card is being added,
including by announcing the name of the card. The opponent must be allowed to verify that the
card has the inkwell symbol around the cost.

The current status of any card in play (exerted or ready, damage marked, whether the card’s ink is
dry, etc.) must be completely and correctly communicated by that card’s player whenever
requested by another player.
Exerted cards should be rotated roughly ninety degrees clockwise to indicate their status. Ready
cards should be upright. A player may choose to exert their cards in the counterclockwise direction
if they choose, but they should be consistent with all of their cards.

Lore gains and losses must always be announced and must include the new lore total after the lore
change for that player. This ensures that both players fully understand the current lore score and
that any discrepancies can be found and remedied as soon as possible, likely with the help of a
Judge.

Players are expected to maintain a clear game state whenever possible. This includes pointing out
mandatory effects whenever they occur, even if they're from an opponent’s card. For purposes of
this rule, a “mandatory effect” is one that doesn’t include the word “may” in its text. Failing to
remind a player of a “may” effect isn’t against the rules, but players are encouraged to remind their
opponents of these effects in order to foster the most positive play experience for all involved.

5.5 Inkwell

Players are required to keep their inkwell cards distinct and separate from any other facedown
cards that may be on the table. If there is ever any confusion about which cards are in a player’s
inkwell, the players should call a judge immediately so the error can be remedied. Additionally, all
ready cards in a player’s inkwell must be oriented in the same direction as each other; the same
must also be true for exerted cards in that player’s inkwell.

A player is allowed to leave the last card they put into their inkwell face-up during the turn it was put
there. Once that turn ends, the player should turn it (and any other face-up cards in the inkwell)
facedown.

5.6 Card Naming and Descriptions

Certain card abilities in Disney Lorcana TCG require that a player must name a card. Stating the
exact printed name of a Disney Lorcana TCG card is the preferred and most accurate method.
However, if a player is unable to recall the exact name, it is also allowed to give a description that
can only reasonably identify a single Disney Lorcana TCG card.

Only cards from the Disney Lorcana TCG may be named or referenced.

In cases where a card’s name or description is unclear, players should call a Judge right away.
Judges have the final authority on whether a description is specific enough to satisfy the ability’s
requirements. Players are encouraged to resolve any uncertainties with the Judges’ assistance.

    •   Example 1
           o Acceptable: “Stitch” or “The character that lets you exert characters you play that
              cost 2 or less ink”.
    •   Example 2
           o Unacceptable: “That one card with the guitar on it” or “The blue card”
SECTION 6: TIME LIMITS

6.1 General Tournament Time Limits

The time limit for a Swiss round is a minimum of 50 minutes, with a recommend time of 60 minutes.

It’s recommended that all matches in single-elimination rounds are untimed. If a time limit must be
imposed due to venue availability constraints, the time limit should be at least 70 minutes and

round would have ended.

SECTION 8: TRAVEL INFORMATION

8.1 Travel Documentation and Accommodations
Players are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any and all travel documentation
necessary to attend and participate in Disney Lorcana TCG events, including passports, travel
permits, and entry visas. It is the player’s obligation to ensure these documents are valid and
obtained in a timely manner.

Tournament Organizers may assist with information that is helpful in obtaining any travel
documentation, but the responsibility is for the players to secure or obtain the necessary
documents. Tournament Organizers are not responsible for any expenses, delays, or
disqualifications caused by incomplete or rejected travel credentials. Players unable to get
necessary documentation could lead to the forfeiture of an invitation to a Disney Lorcana TCG
event.
Tournament Organizers may provide players with travel expenses, such as airfare, hotel rooms, or
travel stipends for official invitations. Any deadlines, rules, or documentation that the Tournament
Organizer provides must be followed by players who are receiving this travel assistance.

8.2 Compliance

Any player that is unable to attend an invite-event, due to Travel Documentation,
Accommodations, or if a player is disqualified or travel is forfeited for any reason, the Tournament
Organizer may find an alternate player to be given to the participant’s Travel Accommodations,
current position in a tournament, and/or the prizing linked to that player’s current placement.
