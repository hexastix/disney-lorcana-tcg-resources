SECTION 1: TOURNAMENT DEFINITIONS
1.1 Tournament Types
Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two types:

Limited tournaments are played with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product that is provided by the Tournament
Organizer. Players aren’t expected to bring any Disney Lorcana TCG cards with them to participate in a Limited
tournament. Limited includes the Preconstructed, Sealed, and Draft variants. (See section 6, “Limited Tournament
Formats.”)

Constructed tournaments are played with decks that the players have built before the tournament begins. Each player is
responsible for bringing a deck that is legal for the specific Constructed format being played at that tournament. (See
section 5, “Constructed Formats.”)

1.2 Tournament Levels
Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are divided into two levels: Casual and Competitive. All tournaments handle in-game
errors by using the Play Correction Guide found at: https://cdn.ravensburger.com/lorcana/play-correction-guidelines-en

Casual tournaments are played with more relaxed rules and fewer, if any, prizes. These tournaments are intended for less
serious play; tournament officials are responsible for assuring that these events are welcoming to less-experienced
players. The focus of Casual tournaments is to be fun and educational for all. Prerelease events are examples of Casual
tournaments.

Competitive tournaments are intended for more serious play, with stricter rules and higher expectations of players. They
also feature unique and sometimes significant prizes for players. Because of this higher standard, players are expected to
be familiar with the rules and policies. Some Corrective Actions from the Play Correction Guidelines are also modified at
this level. The Set Championships and Challenges are examples of Competitive tournaments.

1.3 Tournament Roles
Tournaments may have multiple roles represented:

    •     Tournament Organizer
    •     Head Judge
    •     Floor Judge
    •     Scorekeeper
    •     Player
    •     Spectator

All of the above roles except Player and Spectator are considered Tournament Officials. For purposes of this document,
“judge” refers to anyone acting as Head Judge or floor judge in that tournament.


                                                             3
©Disney                                                                                                      disneylorcana.com
1.4 Eligible Players and Tournament Officials

Anyone is eligible to play in any Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the following exceptions:

    •     Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events.
    •     Any Tournament Official for that tournament (Competitive only).

Anyone is eligible to serve as a Tournament Official for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament, with the following exceptions:

    •     Anyone currently banned from playing in Disney Lorcana TCG events.
    •     Anyone who has played in that tournament, even if they have dropped.

Tournament Officials are allowed to participate in Casual-level events. Tournament Officials are prohibited from
participating in Competitive-level events, including Set Championships.

1.5 Set Legality
 Disney Lorcana sets are legal to play in Disney Lorcana Sanctioned Tournaments three weeks after release in hobby
stores. Alternate and special versions of cards, including preview and promo cards, become legal when their respective set
does, regardless of when they’re released.



SECTION 2: TOURNAMENT ROLES
2.1 Tournament Organizer
The Tournament Organizer for a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament is responsible for a number of tasks, including but not
limited to:

    •     Obtaining permission from Ravensburger to run the tournament.
    •     Providing and furnishing a sufficient site to run the tournament.
    •     Promoting the tournament to ensure sufficient attendance.
    •     Advertising the tournament type and format for player preparation.
    •     Acquiring sufficient staff for the tournament (e.g., judges and a scorekeeper).
    •     Reporting the tournament results to Ravensburger.

2.2 Head Judge
Every Disney Lorcana TCG tournament must have a Tournament Official designated as the Head Judge for that event. This
person must be physically present throughout the duration of the event. For Casual tournaments, the Tournament
Organizer may serve as the Head Judge. For Competitive tournaments, they must be two separate individuals.

The Head Judge is the final arbiter for any rules or tournament policy disputes at a Disney Lorcana TCG tournament. It’s
their responsibility to enforce the codes in this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Comprehensive Rules, and the Disney
Lorcana TCG Play Correction Guidelines. All tournament participants are expected to abide by the Head Judge’s decisions.
                                                              4
©Disney                                                                                                      disneylorcana.com
For smaller tournaments, the Head Judge should be the only judge needed. For larger tournaments, the Head Judge is
expected to delegate tasks to other judges as necessary to facilitate smooth tournament function and timely responses to
player questions.

If a player is dissatisfied with a judge’s ruling, they may appeal the ruling to the Head Judge. The Head Judge’s ruling
 is final.

If any players must be disqualified or otherwise removed from a tournament, the Head Judge must write a report of the
incident and submit it to Ravensburger.

2.3 Judges
Judges are charged with assisting players with rules questions and handling errors made during play. They’re expected to
be impartial and to avoid assisting players with in-game strategy. Judges should not prevent play mistakes from happening
but should instead only pause a match if an illegal action is taken or if a situation requires de-escalation. Judges should
hold themselves to a high standard of sporting behavior and should exemplify this to players and spectators whenever
serving as a judge for a tournament.

2.4 Scorekeeper
The Scorekeeper is responsible for recording all tournament results and generating all tournament pairings. For smaller
tournaments, this role may be served by the Tournament Organizer or a judge. This person should be familiar with the
Melee software (www.melee.gg) so that any issues or errors can be corrected in a timely manner and with minimal
disruption to the tournament. If any egregious tournament scorekeeping issues arise, the Head Judge is the final arbiter
for determining the appropriate action.

2.5 Player
Players in Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments have several responsibilities:

    •     Always being respectful and courteous toward Tournament Officials, other players, and spectators.
    •     Refraining from unsporting conduct at all times.
    •     Arriving for the tournament and for all matches punctually.
    •     Supplying all required tournament materials, including an appropriate deck for Constructed tournaments. This
          can also include dice, a playmat, pen and paper, and non-marked card sleeves.
    •     For Competitive Constructed tournaments, submitting their deck list via Melee or on paper.
    •     Verifying that their match results are reported promptly and accurately.
    •     Properly communicating with their opponent to the best of their ability.
    •     Bringing any and all issues to the attention of a judge as soon as they’re noticed.
    •     Abiding by the rules of this document, the Disney Lorcana TCG Comprehensive Rules, the Disney Lorcana TCG
          Play Correction Guidelines, and all rulings made by judges.

Any assistance given by a judge doesn’t remove these responsibilities.

©Disney                                                                                                         disneylorcana.com
2.6 Spectator
Spectators are expected to allow Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments to proceed unaffected by their observation. Any person
physically present at a Disney Lorcana TCG event who isn’t filling a designated tournament role is considered a spectator.

Spectators are expected to remain silent and unobtrusive while matches proceed, with one exception. If a spectator
observes a rule violation, they should ask the players to pause their game while the spectator notifies a judge. The
spectator should not reveal any details of the perceived violation to the players but should instead relay the information to
the judge so that the situation can be addressed correctly.

Players may always request that a spectator not observe their match. This request should involve a judge. Tournament
Officials may always restrict the ability of spectators to observe matches.

For players who may require assistance to perform game actions or physically handle cards or other game objects, a
spectator can be designated to assist the player. These spectators can ask simple questions to clarify the intent of the
player but aren’t permitted to offer any kind of play or strategic advice.



SECTION 3: TOURNAMENT OPERATIONS
3.1 Player Minimums
A tournament must have a minimum of eight players to be considered an official Disney Lorcana TCG tournament. If at
least eight people aren’t present and ready to participate, the tournament is no longer officially sanctioned by
Ravensburger and should be reported as Canceled.

3.2 Round Minimums
At least three rounds must be played for a tournament to be considered an official Disney Lorcana TCG tournament. If at
least three rounds aren’t played, the tournament is no longer officially sanctioned by Ravensburger and should be reported
as Canceled. For a better player experience, tournaments with more players have more rounds. The recommended number
of rounds to be played based on the number of players in the first round are as follows:

3.3 Match Structure
The Disney Lorcana TCG is played in a 2-game format. Players will play two games, with each player having the
opportunity to go first. Each game is worth 3 match points. If a player wins both games, they’re awarded a bonus match
point. If a match is completed before both games are completed, the player who won the first game receives 3 match
points but isn’t awarded the bonus point. If each player wins a game in the match, both players receive 3 match points but
no bonus point is awarded.

Before the match begins, the players must randomly decide which player has the choice of going first in either game one
or game two. Any mutually agreeable method may be used, such as rolling dice or flipping a coin. The deciding player then
chooses whether they will be the starting player in the first game or the second. The player who plays first doesn’t draw a
card at the start of their first turn. The decision to start the first game or the second must be made before the player sees
their opening hand for game one. If the player fails to decide, they’re assumed to be playing first in the first game.

For single-elimination brackets, there will be a best-of-three format. In practice, this means that the players will play
games until one player has won two games. Before the match begins, the players must randomly decide which player has
the choice of playing first or second in the first game. The deciding player then chooses whether they will play first or
second in that game. For games after the first in a match, the player who lost the most recent game chooses whether to
play first or second in the next game. The decision to play first or second must be made before the player sees their
opening hand for that game. If the player fails to do so, they’re assumed to be playing first in the next game.

3.4 Match Procedure
When beginning a game, players first decide which player is playing first as described in section 3.3. Each player shuffles
their deck and offers their opponent the opportunity for additional shuffling and/or cutting. Then, each player draws their
opening hand of seven cards.

For every game of a match, each player has the opportunity to alter their hand. First, the first player chooses which cards
from their hand they will alter, if any, and places those cards on the bottom of their deck in any order. Then the second
player chooses which cards from their hand they will alter and places those cards on the bottom of their own deck in any
                                                              7
©Disney                                                                                                        disneylorcana.com
order. Then both players draw cards until both have seven cards in their hand again. Finally, any player who placed cards on
the bottom of their deck this way shuffles their deck and then offers their opponent the opportunity for additional
shuffling and/or cutting.

Once this process has been completed, the first player begins their first turn. They will not draw a card for this turn.

Once time has been called in a round, no new games should begin. Any games still in progress will immediately proceed to
the end-of-match procedure, as follows:

    •     The active player finishes their turn.
    •     After that turn, there are five turns total remaining in the game.
    •     Each turn taken after the turn during which time was called will count toward the five-game total, regardless of
          whose turn it is. Normally, this means that the active player when time was called will get two turns and the non-
          active player will get three turns.
    •     If the game ends during these turns, the match is reported normally.
    •     If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and one player has more game wins than the other, that
          player wins the match. (The current game doesn’t count toward the match result.)
    •     Swiss rounds: If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five, award match points as described in 3.3
          to any player who has won at least one game. If neither player has won any game in the match at the end of turn
          five, the game is a draw.
    •     Single-elimination rounds: If neither player has won the game at the end of turn five and both players have the
          same number of game wins and the same lore, the match continues until one player has more lore than the other.
          Once this happens, the player with the higher lore wins the game immediately.

3.5 Concessions and Splits
A player may concede an incomplete game at any time. That player immediately loses the game and, if applicable, the
match moves on to the next game.

A player who refuses to play a match is considered to have conceded that match.

Players can’t ask their opponents to concede a game. Players can’t implicitly or explicitly offer or accept any reward or
consideration in exchange for a concession. Players provided such an offer are required to call a judge and report the offer.

If the round being played is in the 2-Game Format, prior to the end of a match, players may agree to split (1-1) the match. A
player may request a split only once per match and can’t implicitly or explicitly offer any reward or consideration in
exchange for a split. Players provided such an offer are required to call a judge and report the offer. If players agree to a
split, a random player is determined to win game 1, and the other player wins game 2.

©Disney                                                                                                          disneylorcana.com
3.6 Deck Registration
Players in Competitive Disney Lorcana TCG tournaments are required to register their decks.

For a Constructed tournament, players must submit their deck list either via www.Melee.gg or on a paper deck list,
following instructions from the Tournament Organizer or Head Judge. The Tournament Organizer should communicate the
deck list submission deadline. If no such deadline is communicated, the deck lists will be due before the first round is
created.

For a Limited tournament, players fill out a deck list as part of deck construction. These deck lists must be provided to a
Tournament Official by the end of deck construction.

Players may request to see their deck list between matches. These requests will be granted whenever feasible.

Deck lists are considered the ultimate arbiter of which cards the player intended to play. Players must take care to use full
card names, since many character cards have similar names.

The use of official deck list forms is recommended for submitting a deck list but isn’t required. The official deck list forms
can be found at:
 https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/resources

3.7 Deck Checks
Judges at Competitive tournaments will perform deck checks as much as is feasible. Decks should be checked after
shuffling has completed but before opening hands are drawn. Deck checks are intended to verify that players are playing
the correct deck as registered on their deck list.

3.8 Dropping from a Tournament
A player may drop from the tournament at any time. Players are responsible for either dropping themselves using
Melee.gg or by informing a Judge or Scorekeeper. If the player is currently paired for any matches when the request to
drop is made, that player is considered to have conceded all games in that match. Players who don’t show up for their
match will be dropped from the tournament unless they inform the Scorekeeper before that round ends.

If a player drops during a Limited tournament, they keep all cards provided to them by the tournament organizer to
participate in the event. This includes opened and partially drafted booster packs.

©Disney                                                                                                         disneylorcana.com
3.9 Sleeves
Players are allowed to use plastic card sleeves on their cards. These must be free of markings and wear. For official event
and tournament play, sleeves must allow satisfy the following conditions:

    •     They must enclose one single card entirely.
    •     All sleeves must be identical.
    •     All sleeves must have fully opaque backs.
    •     Sleeves that feature suggestive, indecent, and/or offensive imagery or words are strictly prohibited.

Inner or over sleeves are allowed, provided that all other rules for sleeves are followed, with the exception of a fully opaque
back. Tournament officials are the final arbiters on whether a particular sleeve is allowed.

If sleeves need to be changed for a non-urgent issue that is found during a match, Tournament Officials may allow the
change to be made in between games or after the current match is concluded.

3.10 Time Extensions
If a Tournament Official pauses a match for more than 1 minute while the round is being played, they should issue the
appropriate time extension equal to the time the match was paused. For deck checks, the time extension should equal the
time it took to perform the check plus 3 minutes.



SECTION 4: INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
4.1 Written Notes
Players are encouraged to keep written track of lore totals, but they’re not permitted to take any other form of notes
during a match. Referring to outside notes during a match is considered Outside Assistance. This can include, but isn’t
limited to, writing down inkwell cards as they’re revealed, using dice to denote the ink costs of revealed cards, or using
other devices or processes to create some type of record of game information. A Tournament Official will make the final
determination of whether a form of note was made.

Players must not take notes during drafting.

4.2 Electronic Devices
At Casual tournaments, players may use the Disney Lorcana Trading Card Game Companion app for tracking lore and
referring to the card catalog as long as any references are made in a timely manner.

At Competitive tournaments, electronic devices capable of long-term data storage and/or internet access aren’t

4.3 In-Game Information
During games, players are expected to communicate openly with their opponents.

There are two types of information in Disney Lorcana: public and hidden. Information is considered hidden if it exists in
any facedown zone. Although the hand isn’t a facedown zone, it’s considered hidden information from your opponent.
Information in any other zone is considered public.

Players are allowed to know the status, characteristics, and contents of any public zone or of any card in a public zone.
Players are allowed to know only the number of cards in a hidden zone.

If hidden information is revealed to the opponent, it’s considered public Information while revealed.

When adding a card to their inkwell through the normal once-per-turn action, the player adding the card must ensure that
their opponent has full knowledge of which card is being added, including by announcing the name of the card. The
opponent must be allowed to verify that the card has the inkwell symbol around the cost.

The current status of any card in play (exerted or ready, damage marked, whether the card’s ink is dry, etc.) must be
completely and correctly communicated by that card’s player whenever requested by another player.

When a player has multiple simultaneous actions to resolve, that player must announce the order of resolution before
beginning to resolve the first one. The order can’t change once the first action has begun.

Exerted cards should be rotated ninety degrees clockwise to indicate their status. Ready cards should be upright. A player
may choose to exert their cards in the counterclockwise direction if they choose, but they should be consistent with all of
their cards.

Lore gains must always be announced and must include the new lore total after the lore increase for that player. This
ensures that both players fully understand the current lore score and that any discrepancies can be found and remedied as
soon as possible, likely with the help of a Judge.

Players are expected to maintain a clear game state whenever possible. This includes pointing out mandatory effects
whenever they occur, even if they’re from an opponent’s card. For purposes of this rule, a “mandatory effect” is one that
doesn’t include the word “may” in its text. Failing to remind a player of a “may” effect isn’t against the rules, but players
are encouraged to remind their opponents of these effects in order to foster the most positive play experience for all
involved.

4.4 Inkwell
Players are required to keep their inkwell cards distinct and separate from any other facedown cards that may be on the
table. If there is ever any confusion about which cards are in a player’s inkwell, the players should call a judge immediately
so the error can be remedied. Additionally, all ready cards in a player’s inkwell must be oriented in the same direction as
each other; the same must also be true for exerted cards in that player’s inkwell.


                                                              11
©Disney                                                                                                          disneylorcana.com
A player is allowed to leave the last card they put into their inkwell faceup during the turn it was put there. Once that turn
ends, the play should turn it facedown in the inkwell.

Players are allowed to use placeholder cards or tokens to represent the amount of ink in their inkwell, provided that the
actual inkwell cards are kept distinct and separate from any other facedown cards and all rules for inking are still followed.
If there is any dispute involving placeholder cards, the actual inkwell cards will be used to determine the total ink.

A placeholder card for the inkwell must not be a Disney Lorcana card.



SECTION 5: CONSTRUCTED TOURNAMENT FORMATS
5.1 Constructed Overview
“Constructed” describes any event where players are expected to build their decks ahead of time. Currently, there is only
one Constructed format, Core, but more may be added in future updates.

Constructed decks must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size, but a player must be able to shuffle
their deck in a timely manner without assistance.

Constructed decks must not contain cards from more than two ink colors. For example, if a deck contains Amber and
Amethyst cards, it must not contain any Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, or Steel cards.

Constructed decks must not contain more than four of a single card as identified by its full English card name. Character
cards with different subtitles are considered different cards for purposes of this rule. For example, a deck may contain up
to four copies of Ariel – On Human Legs as well as up to four copies of Ariel – Spectacular Singer.



SECTION 6: LIMITED TOURNAMENT FORMATS
6.1 Limited Overview
“Limited” describes any event where players are provided with unopened Disney Lorcana TCG product and are expected to
build their decks on site during the tournament. There are three Limited formats: Sealed, Preconstructed, and Draft.

Limited decks in Sealed and Draft must contain at least 40 cards. There is no maximum deck size, except that decks are
limited in size by the card pool they’re built from.

Limited decks aren’t restricted in how many ink types they may contain.

Limited decks may contain any number of copies of any individual card. For example, if a player in a Sealed tournament
opens six copies of Genie – The Ever Impressive, they may play all six in their deck.

6.2 Sealed
In a Sealed tournament, each player is provided with a set of unopened booster packs from which they will build their
deck.

The minimum number of booster packs to be provided for Sealed tournaments is six per player, from the set(s) of the
tournament organizer's choice. Each player begins with the same number of booster packs from each set selected.

6.3 Preconstructed
In a Preconstructed tournament, players are provided with a random starter deck from the set chosen for the tournament.
Players may add or exchange any number of cards between the preconstructed deck and the booster pack included in
their starter deck box. Since the provided preconstructed deck is 60 cards, the deck must be a minimum of 60 cards after
the deck construction period. Limited-format decks may contain cards of more than two inks.

Preconstructed events are only Casual tournaments.

6.4 Draft
In a Draft tournament, players take turns selecting, or “drafting,” cards from unopened booster packs to form their card
pools.

The minimum number of booster packs to be provided for Draft tournaments is four per player, from the set(s) of the
tournament organizer's choice. Each player begins with the same number of booster packs from each set selected.

Players are seated into random groups called pods. The number of people in each pod is at the discretion of the Head
Judge, although these guidelines should usually be followed:

    •     Each pod should have as close to eight players as possible.
    •     Each pod should have at least six players.
    •     There should be no more than one pod with an uneven number of players.

Following these guidelines, here are the recommended pod sizes for smaller tournaments:

           # of Players          Pods
           6-11                  1 pod
           12-14                 1 pod of 6
                                 1 pod of 6 to 8
           15-16                 1 pod of 8,
                                 1 pod of 7 to 8
           18                    3 pods of 6
           19-20                 2 pods of 6
                                 1 pod of 7 to 8
           21                    Pod of 6
                                 Pod of 7
                                 Pod of 8
           22                    Pod of 6
                                 2 pods of 8
           23                    Pod of 7
                                 2 pods of 8

For the first booster pack, each player opens a pack, selects one card to add to their card pool, then passes the remaining
cards to their left. Then they collect the cards passed from their right, select a card, and pass the remaining cards to their
left. Card selection continues in this manner until all cards from the pack have been drafted.

The direction of passing reverses for each pack after the first: cards from the second pack are passed to the right, cards
from the third pack are passed to the left, and so on. Once all packs have been drafted, each player’s picks become their
card pool for deck construction.

In Casual Draft tournaments, players may be paired against any other player in the tournament.

In Competitive Draft tournaments, players must be paired against players in their own pod.
